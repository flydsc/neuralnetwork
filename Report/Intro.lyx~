Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wine is popular drink for world wide people.
 Different wines owens different quility with different price.
 To define the qulity of one certain wine, reseachers investigated different
 attributes.
 In this report, I picked up a data set from "Vinho Verde" wine related
 to red and white variant wines.
 In this data set, some key features are used to do the wine assessment.The
 wine is better as the level number is larger.
 I am going to use this data to train classfiers to do the classification
 upon both red wine and white wine.
 The main task is to detect the quality of wines based on the result of
 physicochemical test.
 To do that, we need to build a classfier.
 In this report, I am going to present a case study of neural network method
 for detecting the quality of wines.

Data selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My goal in this assignment is to deal with a classification problem.
 Therefore, dataset should be approperate for classfication job.
 I chose this dataset with some reasons.
 Firstly, the data has both features and class labels, which makes the classific
ation job possible.Secondly, this data used in my work is structured and
 numerical data, which is suitable for a neural network classfier.
 If the data contains string featrues or other non-numerical features, the
 data transformation should be done before the neural network classification
 assignment.
 Thirdly, this dataset's associated task is labeled as 'Classification,
 Regression' in UCI Repository.

Data summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the classfication, I explore the dataset to check the condition of
 dataset.
 Generally speaking, the dataset has two parts.
 The first one relates to red wine preference samples with 1600 records
 and the other one relates to the white wine preference samples with 4899
 records.
 The goal of the data is to invetigate physicochemical test to model wine
 quality.
 To do this, I use a tool called Rattle.
 Rattle is a package of R language.
 According to Williams
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "williams2011data"

\end_inset

, Rattle is "simple to use, quick to deploy, and allows us to rapidly work
 through the data processing, modelling, and evaluation phases of a data
 mining project."

, this part consists of 12 variables and the last one is the class label.
 In the data summary, we can see numbers are ranging from 0.012 to 289, which
 means data should be scaled and norminallized before building the model.

, the data of white wine is very similar to the red wine as shown above,
 we also need to do the scale before modelling.
 The quality is represnted by integer.
 The wine is better when the number of quality is larger.The main difference
 between red wine and white wine data is the range of quality.

, the left is red wine with 6 levels from 3 to 8, and the right side is
 white wine with 7 levels from 3 to 9.
 In this case, the red wine would have 6 classes and white wine would have
 7 classes.
 This is important since the number of class would determine the number
 of output as well as the neural network internal structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen, the data is properate for using neural network and the complaxit
y is proper to do the job.

\begin_layout Section
Contributions and outlines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this project my main contributions are building two neural network classfier
 for red wine and white wine respectively, doing the evaluation based on
 the performance of classifers and doing the comparison between neural network
 and other method.
 This report is orgnised as follow: section 2 would prsent the method I
 used in my work, section 3 would prsent the result of my experiment and
 comparison between the result from my work and from related paper,,section
 4 would talk about the result by other method, section 5 would conclude
 the report and state the future work.
